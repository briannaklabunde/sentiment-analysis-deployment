# Sentiment Analyzer (Streamlit App)

A simple **Streamlit web app** for **sentiment analysis**.  
It classifies text as **positive** or **negative**, demonstrating how to deploy a machine learning model to a public web app.

This project was created as a **learning exercise** to understand the process of model deployment and web app hosting with Streamlit.
